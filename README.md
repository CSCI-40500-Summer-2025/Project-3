# Recipe Suggester - Prototype

This is a barebones prototype for a web app that suggests recipes based on your available ingredients and allows saving them locally.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Enter some ingredients and click "Get Recipes" to see a sample recipe.
3. Click "Save Recipe" to store it.
4. Click "Go to Recipe Library" to view saved recipes.
5. From there, click "Generate Grocery List" to see a sample list.

> All data is stored using localStorage.

This is a prototype only‚Äîactual recipe logic is not implemented.
